`13`,`Digital Extremes`,`Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the world's top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry.
Headquartered in London Ontario, Canada’s 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industry’s blockbuster franchises, Epic Games’ Unreal®.

Beginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStation®2, Xbox™ and Dreamcast™ platforms.

Digital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark Sector®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engine™. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.

Digital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Games’ blockbuster, Bioshock® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefront™.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Apple’s iOS platform, a throwback to the company’s roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The Darkness® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to Halo®4.  The studio is currently developing and publishing the Free-to-Play action game, Warframe`,`digital-extremes`, `https://www.igdb.com/companies/digital-extremes`,`1970-01-14T21:48:57.600Z`,`1970-01-16T01:08:16.592Z`
`14`,`Bullfrog Productions`,`Bullfrog Productions was a British developer. It was founded in 1987 by Les Edgar and Peter Molyneux. They were best known for their strategy god games such as Populous.

In January 1995, to strengthen its global positioning, Bullfrog Productions merged with long time publishing partner Electronic Arts. In August 1997, Bullfrog co-founder, Peter Molyneux, left to establish a new development team, Lionhead Productions (who, incidentally, has also signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts). In September 1999, Les Edgar changed his role to consultant for Bullfrog Productions Limited, enabling him to pay more equitable attention to his other business interests. Edgar handed the reins to Bruce McMillan from Electronic Arts' Canadian studio.

Following its purchase by EA, Bullfrog continued to work in its original offices in Guildford as an EA studio, and continued to display its own Bullfrog logo on the boxes of its games. In 2000, Electronic Arts merged its EA-UK offices, which had been in Langley near Slough, with the Bullfrog offices, into a new facility in Chertsey. Around August of that year the company decided to drop all further production of Bullfrog-branded products, and the former Bullfrog employees were put onto new projects such as the Harry Potter series. The last Bullfrog-branded game was Sim Theme Park (also known as Theme Park World and Theme Park 2), released in 1999.

A few compilations of older games that Bullfrog worked on have been published since, but to all intents and purposes the brand has been dead since the move to Chertsey in 2000.

Many Bullfrog developers left to found their own studios and these became Intrepid Computer Entertainment Ltd., Big Blue Box Studios Ltd. and Lionhead Studios. The latter eventually absorbed the first two and became the only studio to carry on the Bullfrog legacy.`,`bullfrog-productions`, `https://www.igdb.com/companies/bullfrog-productions`,`1970-01-14T21:48:57.600Z`,`1970-01-16T01:08:16.592Z`
